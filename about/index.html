         <h2>Biography  </h2>
         <p>Welcome to Chloe's Designs and Creations website. I began my small business journey back in 2017. Since establishing my small business I was able to get my products in store and online. Also, I was able to team up with a few other business owners for collaborations. Over the years as my business grew I had trouble balancing family, work, and my small business. I had to cancel my business to clear off my plate for a year. Fortunately, along the way I was blessed with time and support from my family to reopen my business. When life gave me the opportunity to be my own boss I took it and ran with it. I’m excited to do more designs and creations. In addition, I'm excited to get back out into events and marketplaces to connect with customers and other business owners. </p>

         <h2>History Detail</h2>
         <p> 
          Aloha, my name is Chloe. I’ve been a small business owner since 2017 but cancelled my business in 2019. During the years I was out of business many changes occurred. A couple changes was that I left my full-time job and became a full-time stay-at-home mom. I continued to create products for just family and friends as gifts. Gifting my creations to others helped me remember how much I enjoyed crafting. 
         </p>
         <p>
          Here I’ll share my story and what I’m doing now. Back in 2017, I was struggling to find a career and I needed to help support my family. With life not stopping for anyone I started to list down job titles, job opportunities, and job skills. With that list I chose to become a seamstress and a small business owner. The first three years of business my products were sold at two local shops in Waialua and Haleiwa, Hawaii. I then established an Etsy shop for in-store customers to check out my products remotely.  
          <p>
          During that time my small business was doing well and steady. However, I felt that I needed to pursue a dental career to help support my family even more. In 2018 I landed a career in the dental field. At first I had no problem balancing family, work, and sewing. As time went on I struggled to keep my inventory stocked up. I was at the point where if I had the time and energy I’d do it. 
          </p>
          <p>
          In 2019, I cancelled my business and limited my social media activity. When the pandemic temporarily shut the office down in 2021 I sewed a lot of fabric masks because of the mask shortage. I wasn’t the best at it but I had a few good looking batches. I was able to donate fifty masks to healthcare workers at Pali Momi respiratory clinic. Also, I was still able to help support my family with the profit I made during the shut down. This made me remember how much I enjoy creating products for the public. 
          </p>
          <p>

          In January 2022, with the support of my family and friends I decided to restart my small business. Now, gratefully, I’m able to stay home as a full-time mom to my children and have the time to build my small business again. Despite the struggle I encountered in the past I’ve learned that life comes with many struggles. That you either let it bring you down or you use it as fuel. I’m ready to take on more challenges and push through more struggles to see my business grow. 
        </p>
          <p> goal is to push myself every day to be a better small business and small business owner. Lastly, I will strive to be consistent and steady with creating products and interacting with customers. I’m so excited to move forward and continue working as a small business owner. With a huge heart I’d like to thank all my supporters and customers. Always take care!

        <h2>Product Summary</h2>
        <p>The products I first created were headbands, scrunchies, and neck gaiters. I then continued to challenge myself with creating scarfs, clutches, and coin pursues. Now, I’ve added more creations to the list such as keychains/key fobs, baby bibs, and lanyards. One day I’m going to start designing my own patterns so that I can create products with my own art. With the fabrics and patterns I’ve been using I choose them based on the public's eye. What theme(s) are you into? 
        </p>
        <p>Currently, my products are only found on my Etsy shop. I like to stay up-to-date on all my social media platforms. You’ll find all my latest designs and creations along with updated news and events. Because I work alone, everything I have is limited. To place an order you can visit my etsy shop or you can message me directly.
